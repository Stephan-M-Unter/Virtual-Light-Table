            <h1>Installation</h1>
            <h3>Windows</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Download the latest version from <a href="#">the repository</a>.</li>
                <li>Unzip the file and save the folder to a place on your computer.</li>
                <li>Navigate to the folder and start the "Virtual Light Table.exe" file.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>MacOS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Download the latest version from <a href="#">the repository</a>.</li>
                <li>Unzip the file - by executing the ZIP-file it should automatically be unzipped in place.</li>
                <li>Navigate to the new subfolder and start the Virtual Light Table application.</li>
                <li>IMPORTANT: This will lead to an error message, as the application has not the necessary certification.</li>
                <li>Use CTRL and leftclick on the application. Choose "Open". You will now be asked if you want to open the application regardless.</li>
                <li>The application should open now. This procedure has only to be done once in the beginning.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Linux</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Download the latest version from <a href="#">the repository</a>.</li>
                <li>Unzip the file and save the folder to a place on your computer.</li>
                <li>Ideally, use a command line interface to navigate to the folder and run the application with ". ./virtual-light-table".</li>
                <li>Note: This was the best way for me to guarantee functionality of tensorflow and ML capacity as well.</li>
