        <p>The <b>Virtual Light Table</b> is your digital tool for reconstructing fragmentary objects (one- and two-sided) from digital images. Developed in the <a class="extern" href="https://www.electronjs.org/de/" target="_blank">electron</a> framework, it is a standalone application available for Windows, MacOS and Linux users. It allows you to place your own images on the virtual table - or choose from a large collection of ancient Egyptian papyri. Arrange your objects, measure them and make comments for the future. Save your work, share it with colleagues - or export images in a variety of formats for publication. Contains traces of machine learning.</p>
