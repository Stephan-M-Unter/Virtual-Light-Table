        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <h3>Measurements</h3>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">
                <h4>My measured distance values don't correspond to the image?</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="answer collapsed">
                <p class="issue">Issue: When conducting reconstructions and taking measurements, such as with the measurement tool or by reading numbers from a scale or ruler, you may encounter discrepancies between the measured distances and the image content. Even if a ruler is present in the image, measuring 1cm on it may yield different values on the VLT (Virtual Laboratory Toolkit). How is this possible?</p>
                <p class="solution">Solution: To address this, ensure that you have the correct Pixels Per Inch (PPI) set for your image. If uncertain, edit the image (right-click and select "edit" or press O) and adjust the PPI. You can either manually enter the values if known, or use the ppi-measurement tool to automatically compute the resolution. Simply select the tool and choose two points in the image that are exactly 1cm apart from each other.</p>
                <p class="explanation">Explanation: Many images contain internal EXIF data that stores information about their resolution. The VLT first attempts to read this data to streamline your work. However, the resolution of the recording device (e.g., camera or scanner) does not necessarily match the resolution of the depicted objects. To ensure accurate scaling of your objects, you need a ruler or scale as a reference for 1cm in the image. The mentioned ppi-measurement tool allows you to automatically compute the object's resolution, ensuring precise measurements.</p>

        <h3>Development</h3>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="question">
                <h4>Can I suggest new features/ideas for the Virtual Light Table?</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="answer collapsed">
                <p class="explanation">Yes, absolutely! I would be very happy for suggestions, ideas, and concepts on how to make the Virtual Light Table even more useful for a broad range of scholars. Please head to the <a href="./contact.html">contact section</a> to write to me directly or create a <a href="https://github.com/Stephan-M-Unter/Virtual-Light-Table/issues" target="_blank">Github issue</a> to address some problem or idea you have regarding the software. Please be aware, however, that at the moment further development of the Virtual Light Table has secondary priority as I have to get done with my ongoing PhD thesis. This might result in longer development circles.</p>
