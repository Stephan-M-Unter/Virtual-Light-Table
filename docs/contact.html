        <h1>About - Who is Stephan M. Unter?</h1>
        <p>To give a little bit of background information on myself the following section provides a brief overview of my academic history as the creator of the Virtual Light Table.</p>

        <p>As an Egyptology graduate from Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich, I fulfilled my childhood dream of becoming an Egyptologist. In 2013, I completed my Master's degree there with a thesis on the graphic structuring markings and layouts of ancient Egyptian papyri. Furthermore, I was fortunate enough to participate in several archaeological projects in Tuna el-Gebel, Middle Egypt, from 2010 until 2012.</p>

        <p>At the same time, I did not want to ignore my interest in technology entirely, which is why I commenced a Bachelor's degree in Media Informatics at LMU Munich. In 2015, I completed this degree with the creation of software for exhibiting and examining photographic EXIF data.</p>

        <p>My relocation to the University of Basel afforded me the chance to function as a computational scientist on another archaeological project, specifically the <a class="extern" href="https://lhtt.philhist.unibas.ch/" target="_blank">Life Histories of Theban Tombs</a> project. This granted me experience with various tasks such as constructing and managing databases, and processing and utilising photogrammetric models. In parallel, I pursued a master's degree in computer science, with emphasis on machine learning. In my 2019 thesis, I examined the classification and segmentation of erosion zones in aerial photographs of valleys in Switzerland.</p>

        <p>With my work on the <a class="extern" href="https://crossing-boundaries.unibas.ch" target="_blank">Crossing Boundaries</a> project, I have combined my two academic passions - Egyptology, and specifically papyri, as well as computer science and machine learning. As a result, my dissertation expands beyond the realm of the Virtual Light Table. My research delves into the use of a multi-modal approach for identifying how machines can analyse images and content of ancient Egyptian papyri, and attempt to establish connections between them.</p>
